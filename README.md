# Vibrator

### Simple Android app for starting and stopping the system vibrator

</div>


## What is this?

This is a very simple Android app for starting and stopping the system vibrator.
Using this app it is possible to force your device to vibrate pretty much continuously.

## Why would you want this?

I built this app for myself as a way to aid with battery calibration.
After replacing the battery in your Android device, it is necessary to calibrate the new battery by charging it fully, then completely draining the battery, then charging it fully once again.
In order to speed up the 'draining the battery' stage, you can perform energy-intensive tasks on your device - for example, activating the torch, turning on bluetooth, and of course running the hardware vibrator.

## How does it work?

The app makes use of `android.os.Vibrator` and requests that it vibrate until the user manually stops it.

## What else can you use this app for?

The potential uses of this app are limitless. If you're sick of calibrating batteries, here are some other ideas:
- Make music! Listen to the smoothing sounds of your Androids vibrating in harmony
- Play pranks! Hide your vibrating device in the wardrobe and tell your partner there's a wasp in the house
- Vibe check! Invite all your friends around and throughly vibe check them
