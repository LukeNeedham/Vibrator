This is a very simple Android app for starting and stopping the system vibrator.
Using this app it is possible to force your device to vibrate pretty much continuously.

<strong>Why would you want this?</strong>

Sometimes you want to deliberately use up your device battery - for example, during battery calibration. Vibrating continuously is a quick way to drain your battery.

<strong>What else can you use this app for?</strong>

The potential uses of this app are limitless. If you're sick of calibrating batteries, here are some other ideas:
- Make music! Listen to the smoothing sounds of your Androids vibrating in harmony
- Play pranks! Hide your vibrating device in the wardrobe and tell your partner there's a wasp in the house
- Vibe check! Invite all your friends around and throughly vibe check them
